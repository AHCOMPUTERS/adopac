# Lab 1 - Introduction
In Lab 1 we are starting with an introduction into Pipelines-as-Code with Azure DevOps by building a first, basic Pipeline using the Azure DevOps Website. 

> Goto Azure DevOps, select your Organization and click on your previously created Project. If you have not create an Organization and a Project in Azure DevOps, please start with the preparation tasks in our [Before you start](labs/lab0/before-you-start.md) guide.

## Create a YAML-Pipeline via GUI
Before we can start building our first pipeline, we need a Repository in Azure DevOps. To initialize the default repository we have in our DevOps Project, click on **Repos** -> **Files** and select **Import a repository**.

Here we're now importing the Lab Repository from GitHub:

**Settings:**
* Repository type: Git
* Clone URL: https://github.com/heoelri/adopac.git

And click on "Import".

This will now import the whole Repository from GitHub into your new Azure DevOps Repository.
